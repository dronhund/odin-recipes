Sweet, soft strawberry sorbet that will rival any brand bought in the grocery store. Not being able to find the perfect recipe, I made up my own! Most homemade sorbets resemble an icy slushie, but this one is thickened before freezing, yielding a melt-in-your-mouth treat that will please even the pickiest sorbet lover! Dually great because it can be made in an ice cream freezer, or in your regular freezer.
